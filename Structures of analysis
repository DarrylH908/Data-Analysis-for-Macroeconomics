# Data Analysis for Macroeconomics

This is a panel data regression project using real macroeconomic indicators such as FDI, unemployment, inflation, and GDP. The goal is to assess which factors significantly influence economic performance across multiple countries and years.

## 📦 Dataset
- Source: BPS / World Bank (manually compiled)
- Variables: GDP (nominal), FDI net inflow, unemployment rate, inflation
- Structure: Panel data (countries × years)

## 📈 Methods Used
- Pooled OLS
- Fixed Effects (FE)
- Random Effects (RE)
- Hausman Test
- LM Breusch-Pagan Test
- Robust Standard Errors (HC1)

## 🧠 Key Insights
- **FDI** has a strong positive and significant effect on GDP growth.
- **Unemployment** has a negative and statistically significant impact.
- **Inflation** was found to be statistically insignificant in the model.
- Heteroskedasticity and serial correlation were detected and corrected using robust standard errors.

## 🧰 Tools
- R
- `plm`, `lmtest`, `sandwich`

📝 Notes
This is a dummy project to demonstrate panel data modeling using real macroeconomic indicators. Though framed in a macroeconomic context, the model can also provide insights for multinational investors and business strategists.
